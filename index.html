    <h1>ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>
      Croissant, pronounced khru-ah-son, is a type of puff pastry that‚Äôs light,
      buttery and flaky. It derives its name from its shape, as croissant means
      crescent in French. Though this flaky pastry is often associated with
      France, and is a staple in most French boulangeries (bakeries), food
      historians place its origins in Austria and believe that it was introduced
      to France in the 19th century by two Austrian bakers.
